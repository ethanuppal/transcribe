            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>Transcribe is a cross-platform web app that allows you to slow down and loop sections of an audio file to make transcription easier. You can <a href="#saving-progress">save and restore your progress</a> to work later on.</p>
            <h2 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h2>
            <p>To upload a file, simply click the button indicated at the top of the screen. When you upload a file, even if it is the same file as before, all your progress will be cleared, so make sure to save.</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/after-upload.png" alt="The workspace after a file has been uploaded.">
            <p>Uploading a file will, as said above, generate a fresh workspace. The workspace includes the <a href="#using-the-player">player</a> and <a href="#adding-the-sections">the section editor</a>.</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/workspace.png" alt="A diagram of the workspace.">
            <h2 id="using-the-player">Using the Player</h2>
            <p>There are three buttons in the audio player. The left arrow button goes to the beginning of the audio; the right arrow goes to the end; and the play button starts and stops it.</p>
            <p>When in a section, the beginning- and end-jumping buttons will only go to the bounds specified.</p>
            <h2 id="adding-the-sections">Adding the Sections</h2>
            <p>The following three buttons are the entire interface for the section editor.</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/section-editor.png" alt="The section editor showing the buttons to add, save, and load sections.">
            <p>The <strong>add section</strong> button creates a new section at the bottom of the page.</p>
            <p>The <strong>save section</strong> button will copy some text that represents the sections you have made. More on saving in <a href="#saving-progress">this section</a>.</p>
            <p>The <strong>load section</strong> text is <strong>NOT</strong> a button, but the small <strong>load</strong> to the right of the text box is. More on loading in <a href="#saving-progress">this section</a>.</p>
            <h2>Modifying the Sections</h2>
            <img src="/assets/img/example-section.png" alt="A blank section in the section editor.">
            <p>Here is what all the boxes are for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter the name of the section into the Name box.</li>
                <li>Enter the start time of the section into the Start box, following a MM:SS (minute:second) timestamp format.</li>
                <li>Enter the start time of the section into the End box, following a MM:SS timestamp format.</li>
                <li>Enter the speed of the section into the Speed box.</li>
                <li>Check or uncheck the Loop box to toggle looping.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Press the trash button at the top-right of a section to <strong>irreversibly</strong> delete a section.</p>
            <h2 id="saving-progress">Saving your Progress</h2>
            <p>This website does not store any data—audio files or sections—on servers or locally. Therefore, you must take initiative to save your progress.</p>
            <img src="/assets/img/section-editor.png" alt="The section editor showing the buttons to add, save, and load sections.">
            <p>Press the save button to copy the <a href="#advanced">"section code"</a> to your clipboard. This bizarre-looking string of letters is what encodes all the information needed to bring back your progress.</p>
            <p>This section code does NOT have your audio file, so you must keep that as well. I recommend keeping the audio files in a cloud provider such as Google Drive <em>or (safer) an E2E version</em> and the section codes in any cloud text editor such as Google Docs <em>or (safer) the notes app on your device if it has one</em>.</p>
            <h2 id="lol">The Website Looks Weird</h2>
            <p>The color scheme of this website is abysmal, and I apologize in advance for that.</p>
            <h2 id="advanced">Advanced</h2>
            <p><strong>This section is only for advanced users.</strong></p>
            <p>The sections are stored as a JSON object like so:</p>
            <pre>
{
    "filename" : Name of file,
    "fileModified" : JS timestamp when file was last modified,
    "lastID" : Number greater than or equal to any other section id,
    "currentTime" : The position of the player,
    "sections" : [
        {
            "id" : Unique id,
            "name" : Name of section,
            "start" : Start time in seconds,
            "end" : End time in seconds,
            "speed" : Speed where 1 means original,
            "loop" : Boolean
        }
    ]
}
            </pre>
            <p>You can reorder the way the sections appear in the app by reordering the corresponding JSON objects in the sections array.</p>
